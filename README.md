# eBay Information Search Web App

Created a webpage that allows users to search for products using the eBay API and display the results on the same page below the form. Once the user clicks on a product name to search for product details, your webpage should display 5 tabs which contain a Product info tab, Product photos tab, Shipping info tab, Seller info tab and a Similar products tab related to the product, respectively. Your webpage should also support adding products to and removing products from the wish list and sharing products info to Facebook.
